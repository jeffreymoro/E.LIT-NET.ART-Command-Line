# E.LIT / NET.ART Command Line
====================================

Want to get some of that sweet DOS-style command line action in your browser? This is a purely aesthetic interface through which to give your visitors the illusion that it's 1983 and they're playing *Zork* in their university computer lab's basement.

I made this for the online version of (E.LIT / NET.ART)[http://elit.jeffreymoro.com], a gallery of electronic literature and Internet art curated by yours truly and sponsored by (Five College Digital Humanities)[http://5colldh.org]. Super work in progress, so caveat emptor!

# Does this really need to be its own repository?
=======================================================

After browsing Stack Overflow question after Stack Overflow question from enterprising developers trying to get a command line effect rolling in their browser, I figured might as well share whatever I managed to make, so that a future version of me might find my work and use it. It's dreadfully unsophisticated! But it gets the job done.

# So what does it do right now?
=======================================

Right now it's just an if/else loop pushing typists to different parts of the (E.LIT / NET.ART web site)[http://elit.jeffreymoro.com]. I want to make the logic a bit more sophisticated, and also incorporate some easter egg goodies like an actual text adventure game.

# I'm dreadfully disappointed in this and want to write you to let you know about my disappointment.
============================
